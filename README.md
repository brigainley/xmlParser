xmlParser
=========

XML Parser Created for Computing IV
This project is an XML parser built from the ground up in C++. The project demostrates an ability to write basic classes, 
algorithms, and header/cpp pairs to read in an XML file (assumed perfect syntax) and parse it. Currently, this program
can output the parser states to a file, the basic tree structure of the document to a file, and a JSON converter is being implemented.
